## Is Quotex Legit or a Scam?

Quotex is a trading platform that offers binary options and CFDs. It is
owned and operated by Maxbit LLC, a company registered in St. Vincent
and the Grenadines.

While Quotex claims to be regulated by the Financial Services Authority
(FSA) of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, this is not the case. The FSA
does not regulate binary options or CFDs, and Quotex is not licensed to
operate in any other jurisdiction.

Therefore, we believe that Quotex is a scam and we do not recommend
using it.
